# NWTB Explorer

On April 27, 2025, OC Transpo launched “[New Ways to Bus](https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/service-changes/new-ways-to-bus/)” (NWTB), “the largest bus service change in the City’s history”.

OC Transpo has produced great material to understand [how specific routes have changed](https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/service-changes/new-ways-to-bus/#route-changes). Their [travel planner](https://plan.octranspo.com/plan) (or mapping tools like Transit, Google Maps, or Apple Maps) is also great for figuring out how to get where you need to using the new network.

But it’s hard to really wrap your head around a change of this size. How have service levels changed throughout the day? Where is more or less served now than before?

This site tries to help you answer those questions.

## How to use

You can explore the new network from a few angles:

- [by ward](/wards) (including a city-wide summary)
- [by routes](/routes)
- [by stops](/stops)
- [by maps](/maps) _(this one might break on phones or other less powerful devices—there’s a lot of math going on!)_

## Key terms

- **“stop”**: a physical train or bus stop, usually with a sign and a code (like 3011, Tunney’s Pasture)
- **“arrival”**: a single time when a train or bus arrives at a stop to take on passengers[^stop]
- **“arrival frequency”**: how busy a stop is—for a given window, do buses arrive only 10 times, or 100 times? 

## To keep in mind

- “Weekday”, “Saturday”, and “Sunday” service numbers are based on the following, respectively:
    - 2019–2025 (previous): April 11, 12, and 13, 2025
    - NWTB: May 9, 10, and 11, 2025
    - (Note: we manually added in the [shopper routes](https://www.octranspo.com/en/our-services/bus-o-train-network/service-types/shopper-routes/), even though they wouldn’t all run on April 11 or May 9, so rural service is more accurately represented.)
- The “previous” schedule refers to the schedule pre-April 27, 2025 (since the [2019 “#ReallyBigServiceChange”](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/bus-changes-lrt-ottawa-october-six-1.5304675)), while “new” refers to the NWTB schedule.

## If a page crashes

This is a prototype, meant to show what’s possible with OC Transpo’s schedule data—and to help us understand the scope of this change! There’s a lot of data and number crunching going on, and it may crash at times (especially on phones). 

First, I apologize! 

Second, if you’re able, please [send me a note](https://lucascherkewski.com/contact/) describing what happened. I’ll be happy to try to improve it.

## Thank you

Thanks for checking this out! I hope it helps you make sense of how this change affects not only you, but your neighbours throughout the city.


[^stop]: We use “arrival” to avoid the very confusing “how many stops [do trains or buses make] at this stop”. English, what a language!
