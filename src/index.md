# NWTB Explorer

On April 27, 2025, OC Transpo launched “[New Ways to Bus](https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/service-changes/new-ways-to-bus/)” (NWTB), “the largest bus service change in the City’s history”.

OC Transpo has produced great material to understand [how specific routes have changed](https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/service-changes/new-ways-to-bus/#route-changes). Their [travel planner](https://plan.octranspo.com/plan) (or mapping tools like Transit, Google Maps, or Apple Maps) is also great for figuring out how to get where you need to using the new network.

But it’s hard to really wrap your head around a change of this size. How have service levels changed throughout the day? Where is more or less served now than before?

This site tries to help you answer those questions.

## How to use

You can explore the new network from a few angles:

- [by ward](/wards) (including a city-wide summary)
- [by stops](/stops)
- [by maps](/maps) _(this one might break on phones or other less powerful devices—there’s a lot of math going on!)_

## To keep in mind

This was prepared just before the routing change went into effect, so the site uses the language of “current” and “new”. I’ll fix that shortly, but for now, keep in mind—“current” refers to pre-April 27, 2025, while “new” refers to the NWTB schedule.
